# Purchases

Tasks Completed:

Loaded two separate datasets: a Customer Table and a Purchase History Table

Used both VLOOKUP() and INDEX-MATCH to retrieve and append:

Customer Name based on Customer ID

Region based on Customer ID

Applied IFERROR() to handle unmatched lookups, displaying "Unknown" for missing customer records

Converted both datasets into structured Excel Tables for easier reference, filtering, and dynamic range management

Reorganized and cleaned the merged data for consistency and readability

Performed initial data validation to ensure accuracy of the joined records

Prepared the final dataset for use in pivot tables and future dashboarding tasks
